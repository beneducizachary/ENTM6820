### Introduction to R assignment ###

## Question 1 ##
# Code can be entered in the console (not saved)
# or in a script (to be saved).
# The output of the code is typically found in the console,
# although outputs in the form of objects will be stored
# in the global environment.
# Plots show up in the "Plots" tab found at the bottom
# right of the RStudio window.
# The global environment is the area where R objects
# are stored.
# You can go to the console and type "help()" and
# insert the function of interest into the parentheses.
# An R package is a collection of pre-made functions
# that can be downloaded and used.
# A function is a collection of code used to manipulate objects
# You navigate to the "Packages" tab in the lower right
# window to see all available and loaded functions.
# The working directory is the directory where the R project
# is saved, and we can locate it by running the "getwd()" function.

## Question 2 ##
# In RStudio, go to file and select "New Project".
# Select "Version Control" under "Create a Project".
# Select "Git" as the version control type. 
# If you do not have a Git repository,
# navigate to your browser and login to GitHub.
# Navigate to the "Repositories" tab and click the "New" icon.
# Give the repository a name and select your desired license.
# Inside your new repositoru, select the green "Code" icon
# and copy the url of your repository.
# Paste this url into the Git project wizard, name the local copy of your
# repository, and specify the file path where you would like
# it to be locally stored.
# Your R project should now be linked with Git.

## Questions 3 ##

# A vector is an object of multiple scalar elements (i.e. numbers)
